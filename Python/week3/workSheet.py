'''
Write a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

Create a lambda function to filter out even numbers from the 
list[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Use the filter function for this.

Given the list names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana'], write a
lambda function to sort the names by their lengths using the sorted function.

Use a lambda function and the map function to convert a list of temperatures
in Celsius ([0, 20, 37, 100]) to Fahrenheit.

Create a decorator called memoize that caches the results of a function so that it doesnâ€™t recompute the result for the same inputs. Use it to optimize the performance of a recursive Fibonacci function.
